# SoftwareConstruction_Group38
All four assignmets for SoCo of group 38

if intellij complains when you open 2nd_assignment\...\game, set up sdk, close intellij and open it again

# if the pawns are not displayed - change your working directory in the run configuration to SoftwareConstruction_Group38
i.e. the one that contains 2nd_assignment, this works in both VSCode and Intellij
